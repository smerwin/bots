# Project: macOS-native EVE Online bot host (no BotLab.exe / reactor.botlab.org)

A macOS-native replacement for the closed-source `BotLab.exe` "volatile host",
so the Elm bots in `implement/applications/eve-online/` run on Apple Silicon
without the Windows client and without reactor.botlab.org (BotLab's paid
licensing backend). Non-commercial, not for distribution.

**Status: working.** The host runs unmodified Elm bot source end to end against
the live client — real memory reads, real decisions, real mouse and keyboard
input. Remaining work is refinement, not architecture.

## Start here

Run a bot:

```
cd tools/macos-host
./run_mission.sh          # or ./run_saxrat.sh
./run_mission.sh --help   # this bot's settings and the host's flags
```

Both launchers pass `--execute-input`: they drive the real mouse and keyboard,
and they kill any bot session already running (two bots fighting over the cursor
is chaos). Each bot's `Bot.elm` header lists the game-client setup it needs —
overview columns, module rows, keybinds — and the bot cannot work around a
client that is set up differently.

Prerequisites, both one-time and both explained below: SIP debugging
restrictions off, and `brew install elm`.

The three things a newcomer most often needs to know:

- **A decision in the log is not an action.** The bot re-derives its decision on
  every framework event, several per game reading, but only dispatches input
  once per cycle. Repeated identical decision lines usually mean one action, not
  many. Read `send-effects` task lines for what actually reached the client.
- **The bot only sees what the overview shows.** Rows scrolled out of view are
  in the UI tree but not rendered, and clicking one acts on whatever row was
  recycled into its place.
- **Nothing here is timestamped.** Log lines carry `# [tick.substep] (Ns)`,
  where the `[N.0]` value is the gap since the previous tick. Summing those
  reconstructs wall-clock to within a couple of minutes per run.

## Architecture

The Elm bot never touches memory. It talks to a "volatile host" over a small
JSON protocol (`EveOnline/VolatileProcessInterface.elm`,
`EveOnline/MemoryReading.elm`): `ListGameClientProcessesRequest`,
`SearchUIRootAddress`, `ReadFromWindow` → a generic `UITreeNode` tree
(`pythonObjectAddress`, `pythonObjectTypeName`, `dictEntriesOfInterest`,
`children`). That shape comes from the open-source **Sanderling** project, which
`BotLab.exe` wraps on Windows. The protocol is OS-agnostic, so a macOS host that
emits the same JSON and executes the same effects runs the existing bot logic
unmodified.

BotLab.exe's own toolchain ("Pine", a custom Elm interpreter) isn't needed
either: a bot's `botMain : InterfaceToHost.BotConfig State` is a plain Elm value
that vanilla `elm make` compiles. `tools/macos-host/botlab_host/Main.elm` is a
port wrapper — copied alongside fetched bot source, not part of it — turning
`botMain` into a `Platform.worker` with hand-written JSON codecs for the
host-interface types. Only `EveOnline.VolatileProcessInterface`'s codecs (used
*inside* the opaque `RequestToVolatileProcess.request : String`) must match the
real protocol exactly, since that is unmodified bot source. On Windows,
BotLab.exe runs the bot's `EveOnline/VolatileProcess.csx` as a C# child process
for that sub-protocol; we don't run it at all, and fake a competent volatile
process in Python instead, dispatching the inner JSON to our own memory-reading
tools.

Two protocol details worth remembering. `ReadFromWindowResult.Completed
.memoryReadingSerialRepresentationJson` is `Maybe String`, and the UI tree JSON
inside it is **double-encoded** — a JSON string containing JSON, decoded via
`decodeMemoryReadingFromString`. And each cycle issues **two parallel reads**:
the memory-based `ReadFromWindow` *and* an `InvokeMethodOnWindowRequest
ReadFromWindowMethod` (screenshot-based, returning `windowRect`/`clientRect`/
`clientRectLeftUpperToScreen`/`imageData`). The latter supplies the rect that
translates memory-read UI positions into screen coordinates, so both are needed.

The native Apple Silicon client (`~/Library/Application Support/EVE
Online/SharedCache/tq/EVE.app/.../bin64/exefile`, launched from the separate
Electron launcher) is a real Metal build, not Wine — but still embeds a **Python
2** interpreter for UI and game logic (confirmed by `.so` names like
`_ctypes.so`, and later by struct RE: Python 2's `int`/`long` and `str`/`unicode`
splits are both present). Sanderling's "walk the CPython object graph" approach
applies, with offsets reverse-engineered from scratch.

## Memory access: SIP must have Debugging Restrictions disabled

`task_for_pid`/`ptrace` against a target lacking `get-task-allow` (this game
binary) is blocked by SIP's Debugging Restrictions — not bypassable via
entitlements, Developer Mode, or Developer Tools TCC. Fixed by booting into
Recovery Mode and running `csrutil enable --without debug`. Current state:
`csrutil status` → "Custom Configuration", "Debugging Restrictions: disabled",
everything else enabled. **This is a standing, system-wide reduction**, not
scoped to this project — revert with Recovery Mode and plain `csrutil enable`.

## CPython struct layouts (this build, arm64, Python 2 semantics)

All addresses are per-process-launch (ASLR): re-derive each session, never
hardcode. The one process-independent invariant is that **any valid
`PyTypeObject` has `ob_type` pointing at the `type` metaclass itself**
(`type(type) is type`) — `re_helper.py`'s classifier uses this to name any
pointer without per-class special-casing.

- **`PyObject` header** (stock): `ob_refcnt` `+0x00`, `ob_type` `+0x08`.
- **`PyTypeObject`** (stock): header + `ob_size` `+0x10`, `tp_name` `+0x18`
  (plain `const char*`).
- **Widget/engine-object wrapper** (the "Blue" C-extension binding layer, e.g.
  `User`, `HangarLayer`, every UI widget): 32 bytes — header + `dict_ptr`
  `+0x10` + `weakref_slot` `+0x18`. No `__dict__` in the stock sense; real state
  lives behind `dict_ptr`, which points at:
- **Custom dict** (not stock `PyDictObject`): `0x38` (56) byte header with 8
  inline entries — `refcnt` `+0x00`, `ob_type` `+0x08` (real `dict` type), two
  duplicate `Py_ssize_t`-ish fields `+0x10`/`+0x18`, capacity mask `+0x20`,
  overflow-table pointer `+0x28` (populated once entries exceed inline
  capacity), shared vtable-ish pointer `+0x30` (identical across every dict
  instance — literal ARM64 code, not data). Entries are 24 bytes
  (`hash: 8, key_ptr: 8, value_ptr: 8`), `key_ptr` always a `str`. Inline and
  overflow blocks can hold duplicate or stale copies of a key — dedupe by key
  pointer. `re_helper.py` and `tree_walker.c` both use **last-wins** for
  ordinary attributes and **first-wins** for `'children'` (preserving an old,
  never-fully-explained quirk rather than picking a new policy).
- **`PyASCIIObject`** (compact-ASCII `str`): header + `length` `+0x10` + cached
  `hash` `+0x18` + 4-byte state field + raw ASCII bytes at `+0x24`.
- **`PyIntObject`** (Python 2 `int`/`bool`): header + signed 8-byte `ob_ival` at
  `+0x10`. No arbitrary precision.
- **`PyLongObject`** (Python 2 `long`, genuinely separate from `int`): header +
  `ob_size` `+0x10` (digit count + sign) + digit array at `+0x18`, each digit
  4 bytes and `< 2^30`. Value = `sum(digit[i] * (2**30)**i)`, negated if
  `ob_size < 0`. Accumulate in ≥128-bit precision — a plain `double` loses
  precision above 2^53, which real in-game timestamps exceed.
- **`PyUnicodeObject`** (Python 2 `unicode`, separate from `str`): header +
  `length` `+0x10` + pointer to an externally-allocated **UCS-4** buffer `+0x18`
  + `hash` `+0x20`.
- **Stock `PyListObject`**: header + `ob_size` `+0x10` + `ob_item` `+0x18` (flat
  array of `ob_size` pointers) + `allocated` `+0x20`.
- **`PyWeakReference`**: header + `wr_object` `+0x10` (points back at the
  referent) + `wr_callback` `+0x18` (`NULL` in every case seen).

## UI tree walk (widget → children → JSON)

1. Widget wrapper → `dict_ptr` (`+0x10`) → custom dict → look up `'children'`.
2. That value is a `PyChildrenList` wrapper (same 32-byte shape) → its own
   `dict_ptr` → look up `'_childrenObjects'`.
3. That value is a **stock** `PyListObject` → `ob_item` array of child wrapper
   pointers → recurse from step 1.

Step 3's value is **not always a stock list on the first hop**. Some widgets
nest one children-list wrapper inside another, so `_childrenObjects` yields a
second wrapper with its own `_childrenObjects`. Confirmed live on `ButtonGroup`
(the Accept/Decline/Delay/Track row in an agent conversation). Bailing out at the
first non-`list`, which both walkers originally did, made every such subtree read
as *childless* — so the agent dialogue's buttons were invisible to the bot while
plainly rendered on screen. A silent wrong answer, not an error.
`tree_walker.c`'s `get_children_addrs` now unwraps repeatedly (bounded by
`MAX_CHILDREN_UNWRAP`) until it reaches a stock list. `re_helper.py`'s
`get_children_addrs_from_wrapper` still has the old single-hop behaviour; fix it
there too if a Python-path walk ever needs these subtrees.

Dead end, don't retry: `PyChildrenList+0x20`/`+0x28` look like a linked list but
are CPython's own GC-tracked-object list — every GC object is threaded into one
process-wide cycle-detection list, unrelated to content.

**Root discovery** (`re_helper.find_ui_root`): regex-scan a full memory dump for
EVE's own debug-log repr text, `<ClassName object at 0X[hex]>` — a scannable ring
buffer, so `re.finditer` straight against the `mmap` with no need to load the
file. That text embeds live object addresses, sidestepping any pattern scan.
Then walk `_parentRef` (a weakref to the parent) upward via `wr_object` until an
object has no `_parentRef` — that is `UIRoot`/`'Desktop'`. Two guards:
`_parentRef` can be present but hold the actual `None` singleton (some containers
sit directly under root), so check the value is genuinely weakref-typed before
dereferencing `+0x10` or you silently walk into garbage; and try several seeds,
preferring one whose own class is literally `UIRoot` or taking whichever address
most seeds converge on, since a single seed can be a dead-end subtree such as a
popped-out window.

**Seed/metatype bootstrap gotcha, hit in three separate tools:** don't trust the
*first* repr-scan hit to derive the metatype pointer. The debug-log text can name
an object since destroyed or reallocated — UI widgets churn constantly — so
`find_metatype` on a stale address returns garbage or `None` even when the same
dump holds plenty of valid candidates. Scan up to ~200 hits and validate each
against the `type(type) is type` invariant. Already fixed in `botlab_host.py`'s
`_any_seed_addr`, `reload_drones.py`, and `route_setter.py`'s
`find_valid_seed_addr`; reuse that pattern rather than reintroducing the
shortcut.

Two more real bugs from early runs, worth recognising if the symptoms recur.
The custom dict's `str`-type bootstrap cannot blindly read a fixed inline slot —
it is a sparse hash table and slot 0 is often empty, so walk entries to find any
real key. And the host's main loop must not process only the *first* task in a
response's `startTasks`: a real cycle offers several at once (memory read plus
screenshot read), and later responses offer genuinely new tasks such as the
`SearchUIRootAddress` → `ReadFromWindow` transition. Drain a queue keyed by
`taskId`, extended from every response, until empty.

## Tools (`tools/macos-host/`)

| path | purpose |
|---|---|
| `probe/` | minimal `task_for_pid` feasibility check |
| `memory_sample/` + `save_process_sample.sh` | full process memory dump + `regions.tsv` index + correlated screenshot, for one-off RE |
| `re_helper/re_helper.py` | Python RE tool and library — `dump`/`find`/`walkdict`/`tree` CLI, plus reusable decoders (`read_pystr`, `read_pyint`, `read_pylong`, `read_pyunicode`, `read_pyfloat`, `classify`, `get_dict`, `walk_dict_entries`, `dict_items`, `build_tree`, `repr_scan`, `find_metatype`, `walk_to_root`, `find_ui_root`). Works against a dump (`Sample`) or a live process (`LiveSample`) interchangeably. |
| `live_reader/` | persistent live memory-read helper (binary protocol over stdin/stdout), backs `LiveSample` |
| `tree_walker/` | C rewrite of the whole UI-tree-walk hot path — memory read, struct decode and tree assembly in one attached process, no per-field pipe protocol. ~5x faster than the Python path (~0.4s vs ~2s for a ~2,800-node tree); what `botlab_host.py` uses for `ReadFromWindow` |
| `window_probe/` | window enumeration via `CGWindowList` (bounds in points, backing scale); `--all` sees windows on any macOS Space, not just the active one |
| `cg_input/` | persistent `CGEventPost` input executor, one text command per stdin line (`move`/`down`/`up`/`drag`/`doubleclick`/`keydown`/`keyup`/`scroll`) |
| `botlab_host/botlab_host.py` | the BotLab.exe replacement — fetches bot source (GitHub URL or local path), patches `elm-version`, compiles with `Main.elm`, drives the compiled bot via `driver.js`, dispatches every `Task` type |
| `botlab_host/Main.elm`, `driver.js` | port wrapper + Node bridge (newline-delimited JSON) between the Python host and the compiled bot |
| `run_saxrat.sh`, `run_mission.sh` | launchers for `eve-online-saxrat` / `eve-online-mission-runner`; one-bot-at-a-time guard kills any prior launcher/`botlab_host.py`/`driver.js`/`tree_walker` first |
| `bot_help.py` | backs `--help` on the launchers |
| `stall_watch.py` | watches a running bot's log and screenshots the client when it stalls |
| `reload_drones.py` | standalone one-off: refill drone bay from station hangar |
| `route_setter/route_setter.py` | standalone one-off: set the autopilot route from a chat channel's MOTD |

**Launcher `--help`** is answered *before* the one-bot-at-a-time guard runs, so
asking what the settings are never kills a session in progress. `bot_help.py`
restates nothing: settings come from the bot's own `Bot.elm` — its
`## Configuration Settings` header section, plus every key `parseBotSettings`
accepts, reported separately where the header omits one — and flags from
`botlab_host.py --help`. A bot gaining a setting shows up with no launcher edit.

**`stall_watch.py`** takes a log path, `--pid` of the client and `--out` for
screenshots, and exits on the first stall so a caller can act on it:

```
python3 stall_watch.py <log> --pid <game pid> --out <dir>
```

A stall is either the bot saying *"I am stuck here and need help to continue."*
(`askForHelpToGetUnstuck`, never normal), or the same decision repeating 60
times. That threshold is calibrated against 55 past runs, where runs of ≥80
identical decisions are 0.74% of all decision runs — comfortably above ordinary
waiting and below the real pathologies, the worst of which reached 8,983 repeats
of "I see a message box to close". It screenshots the game **window by id**
(`screencapture -x -o -l`), not the screen, because the client is usually on
another macOS Space where a screen grab catches the wrong desktop.

**Bot source acquisition** (both tested): a local file or directory path (or
`file://`), or a GitHub URL — a plain repo, or a `.../tree/<branch>/<subpath>`
URL, needed since apps in *this* repo live under `implement/applications/...`
rather than the repo root, cloned with `git clone --depth 1 --branch <branch>`.
Both then search recursively for `Bot.elm`.

**Important:** `route_setter.py` and `reload_drones.py` drive real input directly
and are **not** part of the bot loop. Never run them alongside a launcher session
— both fight for the same mouse and keyboard, and a stray background run once
caused a long, confusing debugging detour. Check with `pgrep -f` on the same
patterns the launchers' guard uses before starting either.

## Coordinates and input execution

The game's internal UI coordinates (`_displayX`/`_displayY`) are laid out against
`UIRoot`'s own reported virtual-canvas size (`_displayWidth`/`_displayHeight`),
**not** a fixed Retina backing scale. Self-calibrate
`scale_x`/`scale_y = UIRoot's reported size / real window point size` (from
`window_probe`) every session; don't assume 2.0. `cg_input` wants real screen
points — confirmed by a `CGEventGetLocation` round-trip, where commanding a move
to `(10,10)` reads back exactly `(10.0, 10.0)`. The scale mismatch is entirely in
what the *bot* computes upstream, which is why the fix lives in
`ReadFromWindowMethod`'s reported rect and `_windows_input`'s outbound
conversion, not in `cg_input`. Windows virtual-key codes
(`Common/EffectOnWindow.elm`'s `vkey_*`) need an explicit lookup table to macOS
`CGKeyCode`s (`_VK_TO_CGKEYCODE` in `botlab_host.py`) — neither side is
contiguous for letters or digits, so no arithmetic mapping works.

**Input effects the bot can express.** `Common.EffectOnWindow` defines the
vocabulary; `EveOnline.BotFramework` maps it onto the host-interface items;
`botlab_host.py` and `cg_input` execute it. Three gestures need more than the
obvious:

- **Double click** is not two clicks. macOS only treats the second press as a
  double click if it carries `kCGMouseEventClickState = 2`, which is why
  `cg_input` has a dedicated `doubleclick` command. The bot emits two
  press/release pairs with nothing between them, and `botlab_host.py` collapses
  that shape into the one command. EVE reads a double click as "Open Cargo", and
  from outside looting range answers by flying there and opening on arrival — so
  it replaces a whole right-click cascade *and* the separate approach.
- **Drags must not pause after the press.** The framework interleaves a
  `WaitMilliseconds` between every pair of effects, and EVE reads a press
  followed by a pause as a click, with the later motion as the cursor wandering
  off. `botlab_host.py` skips those waits while a button is held, except the one
  before the release, which the drop still needs.
- **Scrolling** goes wherever the cursor is, so `effectsMouseScrollAtLocation`
  carries the move with it.

**Mouse movement.** Glide through intermediate points rather than teleport
(`_move_mouse_eased`) — Photon UI cares about real trajectories, not just final
position, for more than one kind of gesture. But **don't re-issue an identical
move**: a hover-triggered flyout needs sustained, uninterrupted dwell, and
re-gliding to the same spot every tick resets that timer before it accumulates,
producing an endless open/close flap that looks like hard failure.

**In-game hotkeys, preferred over a cascade wherever one exists** (this account's
bindings): `Shift+F` launches drones, `F` engages the current target, `Shift+R`
recalls, `Alt+F1` toggles the propulsion module, `F1`–`F4` are weapon slots 1-4,
`Ctrl+W` closes the active window — all confirmed live. `Alt+C` for the inventory
is EVE's default and is used by the courier-pickup path, but has not yet fired in
a real run.
A keypress is one effect where a cascade is a multi-tick right-click → hover →
click with its own retry logic. Note `Alt+F1` is a *toggle*, not a "deactivate" —
press it only when the module reads active.

**Window resolution must pick the largest window by area** for a pid, not the
first over a width threshold: a fullscreen game window has a smaller same-width
overlay (the reveal-on-hover menu-bar strip, ~1710×44) that a naive check picks
by accident, giving a badly wrong y-scale and bogus click targets. `window_probe
--all` (`kCGWindowListOptionAll`) makes this work regardless of which Space the
game is on — the on-screen-only query sees nothing when that Space is inactive.

**`cg_input` must stay one persistent process** across a whole move→down→up
sequence: it tracks click position as process-local state set by the last `move`,
so a fresh process per command always clicks at `(0, 0)`, which looks exactly
like the cursor teleporting to the top-left corner.

**`BringWindowToForeground`** should check `_window_is_onscreen()` first and skip
the activate-and-sleep when already there — `BotFramework.elm` prepends it to
*every* input sequence, so the common case is "already frontmost", and paying an
unconditional `osascript` plus sleep was the real source of felt sluggishness.
Equally, don't re-verify the window before every individual action in a sequence;
that cannot change between two `CGEventPost` calls milliseconds apart. Check only
at the sequence's own `BringWindowToForeground`/`AbortIfWindowNotInForeground`
checkpoints.

## Reading the overview

The overview **virtualises**: every object in space has an entry in the UI tree,
but only the rows that fit are rendered, and the rest keep whatever position they
last held while recycled. A hidden entry therefore reports a plausible region
pointing at a row that now belongs to something else, so clicking it is worse
than a no-op — it acts on the wrong object. `_display` is what distinguishes
them; the region does not. Filter on it before locking, looting or activating
anything.

To reach a row that is off screen, turn the mouse wheel over the overview a notch
at a time and re-read between notches. Do **not** compute a scrollbar position
from the target's rank by distance: that assumes the list is distance-sorted and
every row is a distinct live object, and neither holds. It failed silently in
practice — the arithmetic clamped to the top of the track, where the handle
already was, so a zero-length drag emitted no movement at all while the log
happily reported a scroll every tick.

Distances only parse as `m` and `km`. An **AU** distance is an `Err`, which every
consumer turned into a `999999` placeholder that reads as merely far rather than
unreachable — one run logged "Failed to read the distance" 444 times. Exclude
those objects from anything the ship might act on.

## Context-menu cascade robustness

`EveOnline.BotFrameworkSeparatingMemory.elm`'s shared cascade logic
(`useContextMenuCascadeWithCustomConfig`) discards and reopens a menu that looks
unchanged across a lookback window — currently 8 readings, widened from 3 then 4
each time real cascades were found giving up too early on a slow Photon UI
flyout. `discardContextMenuIfTooDistantFromTargetElement`'s distance tolerance is
per-cascade-tunable; the shared 70px default is not enough for every element, and
both the route-jump icon and the locked-target-bar unlock icon needed 200px.

`beginCascade`'s fallback for "target fully occluded by an existing menu" presses
**Escape** rather than right-clicking a computed "empty space" location — that
location is not reliably empty, can land on a real Neocom icon, and whatever it
opens then sits in the way of the next click. Confirmed live: this caused an
accidental "Clear All Waypoints" on a real route.

`clearStrayContextMenu` presses Escape if a menu has sat at the same depth,
byte-for-byte unchanged, for 3+ ticks — catching a stray menu on a tick where the
decision tree isn't touching menu logic at all, which the cascade's own recovery
cannot do since it only runs while actively driving a cascade.

## Ship modules

Module buttons come in rows, and the row list is **not a stable index space**:
the parser drops any node whose display region it cannot read, so a slot can
leave and rejoin while nothing moves on screen. Identify a module by position —
sort the row by `x` — not by index. Indexing clicked a neighbouring module live.

`isActive` reads `ramp_active` off the button, and on this client that entry does
not exist until the module has run: the `ShipModuleButtonRamps` widget holding it
is created when the module starts cycling and destroyed when it stops. So a
module reads `Nothing` when off-and-never-run, `Just True` when running, and
`Just False` only when off after having run. Treat `Nothing` as off. `isBusy` and
`isHiliteVisible` are permanently `False` here — their sprites don't exist in
this build — so they are no use as a second opinion.

A module button is a **toggle**, so a click repeated before the client has shown
its result switches the module back off. `moduleButtonClickSettlingSteps` gives a
click 5 steps to appear in a reading first.

## Elm toolchain

`brew install elm` (arm64-native bottle) — **not** `npm install -g elm`, which
either grabs an unrelated package squatting the name or, pinned to `elm@0.19.1`,
fails on a broken arm64 download URL. Homebrew's build self-reports `0.19.2`
while every bot's checked-in `elm.json` says `"0.19.1"`, and an application-type
`elm.json` requires an exact match — so patch `elm-version` to `"0.19.2"` in a
**working copy** before compiling, never in the checked-in source.
`botlab_host.py` does this automatically.

## Screenshot / pixel data

Opt-in via `--capture-screenshots`, off by default: it costs ~1.6s per cycle,
dominated by the `screencapture` call, and most bots never read pixel data.
Format reverse-engineered from `BotFramework.elm`, not guessed. `pixelsString` is
a plain JSON array of `0x00RRGGBB` ints (`red<<16|green<<8|blue`), row-major,
height implied by `array length / widthPixels`. `ImageCrop.offset` is in the same
self-calibrated "game pixel" units as `clientRectLeftUpperToScreen` for
`_original` crops, but pre-divided by the binning factor for `_binned_2x2` and
`_binned_4x4`. All three resolutions are genuine area-averaged downsamples of one
capture (PIL's `Image.BOX`, a true block average rather than a blurring resize).
Pack with vectorised numpy — the naive per-pixel fallback, used when numpy is
missing, cost 5.2 of 8.2 total seconds by itself. `_original` is generated empty
(`[]`, valid per the type) by default, since a full-resolution Retina crop packs
to ~66MB of JSON and no bot in use reads `pixels_1x1`; the code to build it still
exists.

## Current status

- **Memory reading, root discovery, UI tree walk:** working and fast, via the
  native `tree_walker`.
- **Input execution:** working (`cg_input`), gated behind `--execute-input`.
- **Full bot loop:** proven end to end for `eve-online-mission-runner` and
  `eve-online-saxrat`, and for `eve-online-warp-to-0-autopilot`, from both a
  local path and a GitHub URL. `eve-online-mining-bot` still compiles (older
  host-interface version, untouched). `eve-online-wingus` is unexplored.
- **`eve-online-mission-runner`** takes a security mission from an agent, flies
  out, clears each pocket through its acceleration gates, returns and hands in.
  Across 55 logged runs it completed 48 missions, median 58 ticks (~5.4 min).
  Combat features in 79% of them, gates 33%, looting 21%.
- **`route_setter.py`** works — reads a chat channel's MOTD, parses the embedded
  `showinfo:5//<systemID>` links (tag-stripped, so a malformed `Sizamo</loc>d`
  still recovers as `"Sizamod"`), right-clicks each in the packed rich text and
  picks "Set Destination" then "Add Waypoint", verifying each click against the
  menu's own "Avoid X (Solar System)" text first. Genuinely fragile next to the
  main bot loop; run it standalone.
- **ESI (the official API) is not viable here.** `POST
  /ui/autopilot/waypoint/` would be the correct way to set a route, but
  registering a developer app now requires a real-money EVE Store purchase,
  which conflicts with this user's no-spend policy. UI automation it is.

## `route_setter.py` internals worth knowing before touching it again

Locating a system-name link inside the MOTD's packed rich text is the whole
difficulty: it is not a separately-addressable node, the entire block is one
`Label`'s `_setText`, so the only way in is to right-click at a guessed position
and check what menu comes back. Several rounds of live-verified fixing, each
guarding against a failure that looks like being stuck:

- **Steer both directions.** Correct a miss by the *signed* line-count
  difference, using the route's own ordering. A down-only fallback jams
  permanently once it overshoots.
- **On blank space, nudge in the last steering direction**, not always down, or
  a correct upward correction gets undone by the next attempt landing in an
  inter-line gap.
- **Try several x positions** — `(30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180)`. Short names
  don't reach as far right, and double-digit line numbers shift where the name
  starts.
- **Don't stop the x-scan at the first non-empty menu.** Right-clicking plain
  text returns a real but useless "Copy | Copy All".
- **Verify the menu closed** rather than sleeping after Escape, or the next
  right-click re-reads stale state.
- **"Set Destination" replaces the entire route**, so clicking it on the next
  intended system is a clean reset with no separate clear step.

EVE's "Search for anything" bar does **not** yield a readable results list from
type+Enter — tested with generous waits, with and without a trailing Return, and
a full tree sweep afterwards found nothing new. Revisiting it needs
screenshot-driven RE, not more polling.

## Open gaps

- `dictEntriesOfInterest` doesn't recursively encode non-primitive "interesting"
  values the way Sanderling's serialisation does. `getDisplayText` in
  `ParseUserInterface.elm` falls back to decoding a non-string `_setText`/`_text`
  as *another full `UITreeNode`* — a real case, since it can hold a Python `Link`
  whose own `_text` has the actual text. Symptom seen live: "current solar
  system: Unknown" for a name that isn't a plain string in memory.
- `MouseMoveRelative` and `CharacterDown`/`CharacterUp` (raw Unicode text input)
  aren't implemented in `botlab_host.py`.
- No automated Elm-toolchain bootstrap if `elm` isn't on `PATH`.
- `reload_drones.py` only searches the root Item hangar, no sub-folders.
- Tested against a handful of bots and one display configuration (single
  display, specific Retina scale). Non-EVE bots using
  `OpenWindowRequest`/browser automation are stubbed to always fail.
- Tick time is dominated by the bot's own `bot-step-delay` (499ms by default)
  plus the read cycle, giving roughly 7s per tick in practice. That is bot-
  authored pacing plus host overhead, not a host bug.

## Repo state

`origin` = `Viir/bots` (upstream, untouched); `fork` = `smerwin/bots` (personal,
added with `git remote add` — `gh repo fork --remote` reported success but did
not actually add it). Work is committed and pushed to `fork` `main`.

Root `.gitignore` excludes `.DS_Store`, `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, and the
ad-hoc-signed compiled tool binaries (`probe`, `memory_sample`, `tree_walker`,
`live_reader`, `window_probe`, `cg_input`). Each has adjacent `.c` source;
binaries are platform-specific build output, so a fresh clone must rebuild them —
e.g. `clang -O2 -framework ApplicationServices -o cg_input cg_input.c`.
